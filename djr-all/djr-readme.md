## Notes for my stuff specifically

00 - genearlly (or 0, or un-numbered) was when I was taking derivative of voltage with respect to injections at every load and every generator on the BH small 02 network (which has 230 loads and 30 generators). However, as I eventually learned, this gets tricky. 
01 - (or 1) now taking derivative with respect to NET injections at each UNIQUE node. There are 209 unique nodes that have a load a gen or both (they all have a load, one of them has 2 loads, and 30 of them have a gen). This means that now everything is 209x209 instead of 1072x240 or something
